# Charge‑Neutral Predictions

This repository provides an implementation of the message passing neural network (MPNN) described in:

> Raza, A., Sturluson, A., Simon, C. M., & Fern, X. (2020).  
> Message passing neural networks for partial charge assignment to metal–organic frameworks.  
> *The Journal of Physical Chemistry C*, 124(35), 19070–19082.

## Usage

To run the training and evaluation pipeline:

```bash
python MPNN/main.py
```
